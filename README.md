Connect 4 player

This is a connect 4 player with a graphic user interface (pygame) so humans can play against it. For each board position, I extracted some features such as the number of 3-in-a-row sequences of either player. The connect 4 player computes a weighted sum of these features to decide the best move to play at each step.

The next step would be to train this connect4 player to adjust the weight vector.

Here is the connect 4 player in action:
